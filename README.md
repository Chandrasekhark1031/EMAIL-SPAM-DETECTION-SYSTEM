Email Spam Detection System :
Built an NLP-based classifier to detect spam emails using TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes algorithm. 
Data Preprocessing: Utilized Regular Expressions and NLTK for cleaning, tokenization, and normalization of raw email text. 
Feature Extraction: Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features. 
Model Training: Trained a Naive Bayes classifier, achieving ~98% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning. 
Real-Time Prediction: Built a user-input interface to classify emails in real time as “spam” or “not spam”.
